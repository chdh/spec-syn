# SpecSyn - Spectral Harmonic Synthesizer

SpecSyn is a browser-based web application for analyzing and re-synthesizing short harmonic sound samples.
It is specifically designed for experimenting with new methods of vowel analysis and synthesis.
It can used to learn about the characteristics of vowels by using the analysis-by-synthesis principle.

The sound analysis and re-synthesis is based on the following three function curves:

- Overall spectrum (amplitude over frequency)
- Amplitude curve (overall signal amplitude over time)
- Frequency curve (fundamental frequency over time)
